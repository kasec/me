# Vite Setup with Vanilla JS

## We're going to set up Vite with vanilla JS to know how it works, create function abstractions, dynamic imports, etc.

## Introduction

If it is the first time you hear about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it is a *dev web server*, hence you can run your html files with *hot module loading*, supports `jsx` and `ts` out of the box, also with [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) integration, so with this tool you can bundle your web projects too.

Now I'm going to begin with a minimal configuration to start with vite environment, just following the next steps. 

## Steps to follow.

### Initialize your project.

1. Create our directory `vite-react-twnd`
2. Open your Editor.
3. I will be working with **yarn** instead **npm**, but you can use whatever you want.
4. Initialize your JS application `yarn init`.
5. Install **vite** devDependency `yarn add -D vite`.
6. Add in `package.json` in something similar to this.
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "dev": "vite"
    }
    ```

### Add files from scratch without using vite templates.

#### Add the entry file(`index.html`).
```html
<body></body>
<script src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```
> As you can see *vite* supports jsx files in browser side, if you don't believe it, try it yourselft without vite.

#### Create `src/main.jsx` file.
```js
const App = `<p>Hello World!!!</p>` 
const add_content_button = document.getElementById("add-content")
const RootElement = document.getElementById("app")

// render element in dom
RootElement.innerHTML = App
```

#### Create abstraction/function to inject html in element, adding jsdoc.
   
Now let's create a function that injects content into the DOM element.

```js
    // create-element.js
    /**
    * @description Remplaza el html de un elemento dato
    * @param element Es un HTMLElement
    * @param content Es un string con/sin html elementos dentro
    */
    export default function(currentElement, content) {
        return currentElement.innerHTML = content
    }
```
As you see in snippet from above, I’ve created a simple function just get two params, a `DOM` element and string content, which will be rendered in DOM element. Also, I’ve added a *JSDOC* description, now when you try to use this function you will see a popup similar to the below image. 

![JS Doc Implementation seeing in action](/assets/images/vite-vanilla-js/js-doc-implementation.png "JS Doc Implementation seeing in action")

#### Following we are going to edit our `main.js` file

```js
    import createElement from './create-element.js'

    const App = `<p>Hello World!!!</p>` 
    const add_content_button = document.getElementById("add-content")
    const RootElement = document.getElementById("app")

    createElement(RootElement, App)
```

> If you want to run the above code, it does not works, the reason, regular *script* does not support imports declarations, try to add `type="module"` in the script tag.
> ![Implementing Importation with script files](/assets/images/vite-vanilla-js/type-module.gif "Implementing importation with script files")

Now our script is cleaner than before. Following I want to introduce with **dynamic imports**, everything what I need will be loaded on demand and not in the beginning, the main advantage of it is that you reduce your initial load.

```js

const App = `<p>Hello World!!!</p>` 
const add_content_button = document.getElementById("add-content")
const RootElement = document.getElementById("app")

add_content_button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    import('./create-element.js').then((response) => {
        response.default(RootElement, App)
    })
})

```
The above modification to `main.js` render the element until the button event is triggered, hence `create-element.js` file is loaded at that moment not before.

## Overview

I see a lot of topics in the post,  some are really important in web development, as *function abstractions* and *dynamic importation*, also we saw how to start with vite and its really fast dev server.
I hope this information was really helpful.
Maybe I'm using some antipatterns if it is the case please contact me(below are my social links).
